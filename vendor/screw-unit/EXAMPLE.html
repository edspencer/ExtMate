  <!--
    This file is a fully-functioning example test case. Try opening this file in Firefox, Safari,
    or Internet Explorer to see what a running test looks like.
    This file demonstrates the the components involved in writing a simple test, such as:
      * The necessary HTML to run a test (with the required <script> and <link rel="stylesheet"> tags),
      * A "custom matcher" (i.e., a custom assertion) to make your tests more readable,
      * And, a simple test with the necessary boiler-plate code to get you up and running.
    Typically, these components are separated out into multiple files. To see what a more typical suite
    of tests look like, look at the larger example in the examples/ directory.
