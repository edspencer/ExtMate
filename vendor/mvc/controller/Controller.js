 * <h1>Controllers in Ext MVC</h1>
 * <p>Controllers are the glue that stick applications together. They listen to events emitted by the UI as the user
 * clicks interface elements, and take actions as appropriate. The relevant action may be to create or save a model
 * instance, to render another view, to perform AJAX requests, or any other action.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Controllers should be kept skinny as far as possible - receive an event, then hand any processing off to the 
 * appropriate model. This ensures we can keep the code as DRY as possible and makes refactoring easier.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Example Controller</h2>
 * Here is a simple example controller which renders a couple of views and listens to events:
<pre><code>
//simple controller which manages the Page model within our application
MyApp.controllers.PagesController = Ext.extend(ExtMVC.controller.Controller, {
  name: 'pages',

  //renders the 'Index' template and sets up listeners
  index: function() {
    this.render('Index', {
      listeners: {
        scope   : this,
        'edit'  : this.edit,
        'delete': this.destroy
      }
    });
  },

  //renders the 'Edit' template (let's say it's a FormPanel), and loads the instance
  edit: function(instance) {
    this.render('Edit', {
      listeners: {
        scope  : this,
        save   : this.update,
        cancel : function() {
          alert("You cancelled the update!");
        }
      }
    }).loadRecord(instance);
  },

  //when the 'delete' event is fired by our 'Index' template (see the index action), this method is called.
  //In this fictional example, we assume that the templates 'delete' event was called with the single argument
  //of the Page instance the user wishes to destroy
  destroy: function(instance) {
    instance.destroy({
      success: function() {
        alert("The Page was deleted");
        //at this point we might render another page for the user to look at
      },
      failure: function() {
        alert('Curses! The Page could not be deleted');
      }
    });
  },

  //when the 'save' event is fired by our 'Edit' template, this method is called.
  //Again, we assume that our template fired the event with the Page instance, and also an object with updates
  update: function(instance, updates) {
    //this applies the updates to the model instance and saves
    instance.update(updates, {
      success: function(updatedInstance) {
        alert('Success! It saved');
        //at this point we might render another page for the user to look at
      },
      failure: function(updatedInstance) {
        alert('Darn it. Did not save');

        //here we're firing the controller's update-failed event, which the view can pick up on
        //The view can simply listen to our Pages controller and add errors from this instance to the form
        //using form.markInvalid(instance.errors.forForm())
        this.fireEvent('update-failed', instance);
      };
    });
  },

   //Sets up events emitted by this controller. Controllers are expected to fire events, so this method is called
   //automatically when a controller is instantiated. Don't forget to call super here
  initEvents: function() {
    this.addEvents(
      //this event will be fired when the controller can't update a Page instance
      'update-failed'
    );

    MyApp.controllers.PagesController.superclass.initEvents.apply(this, arguments);
  }
})
</code></pre>
 * Note that many of the methods above are provided by the {@link ExtMVC.controller.CrudController CrudController}
 * 
 * <h2>Rendering Views</h2>
 * Each controller can automatically render view classes inside its views package. In the Pages controller above the
 * views package is MyApp.views.pages - the application itself is called MyApp, and the 'pages' segment comes from the
 * controller's 'name' property
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * In the example above, the line: <pre><code>this.render('Edit', {})</code></pre> will automatically find the
 * MyApp.views.pages.Edit class, with the second argument to this.render being a config argument passed to the view's constructor.
 * 
 * <br />
 * <h4>Rendering strategies</h4>
 * Not all applications will render views in the same way
